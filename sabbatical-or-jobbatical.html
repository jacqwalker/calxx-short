              <p class="bold-para">The workforce is changing and so are its habits. Not only is the age of workers increasing, but time off work, something that was previously rare and frowned upon, is becoming more common. I’m not sure we are at the point where taking a sabbatical every few years is accepted, but with each successive generation we’re moving closer and closer to it.</p>
              <p>In a <a href="https://business-reporter.co.uk/2017/07/14/51-new-retirees-planning-work-past-state-pension-age/" class="font-blue">survey</a> conducted by Prudential last month, it was found that 51% of workers set to retire this year plan on working past the state pensions age. Until a few weeks ago, this age was expected to be 68 by 2044, but the government has since announced that this age increase will be brought forward to between 2037 and 2039.</p>
              <p>Generationally, there are marked changes in working habits. Baby boomers (those born between approximately 1946 and 1964) were lifers. They started at one company and stayed there for the entirety of their careers, likely retiring at 50.  Millennials (1980 - 1995) and Generation Z (1986 to present) want a more equitable work life balance. In the younger generations, quitting your job to go travelling or taking time out is accepted, but Generation X (1965 to 1979) and some of the older Millennials are caught in the middle. Working for one company for your whole career is no longer an option due to the changing jobs market, but having gaps on your CV is still frowned upon, especially by the earlier generations who are now in middle to senior management.</p>
              <p>The Prudential research also highlighted a period of ‘pretirement’ where people are choosing to delay their retirement and look to change jobs, earn money from hobbies or go part-time. It’s easy to see how a similar concept will be adopted by younger workers, taking a year out here and there as they are likely to have a 50-year career if they begin employment at 21 or 22. </p>

              Stefan Sagmeister agrees. He runs a design studio in New York and in 2009 gave a Ted Talk on the power of time off. Every seven years, Sagmeister closes his studio and takes a year’s break. We spend the first 25 years of our lives learning, then 40 years working and 15 years in retirement. His theory is, that if you cut five years from retirement you can intersperse it into your working years. He finds that taking the time off has wider benefits than just ‘enjoying himself’. It flows back into his company through the development of new products due to an increase in creative productivity that some time off affords, and also leads to greater quality output and the ability to increase asking prices as that quality improves. </p>

              <p class="para-after-aside">Very few of us can close up shop for a year, but if you are at a junction in your job or career and need a change we may have a solution for you.

              <p>Instead of having to explain away a gap to a future employer, you will have filled the time living in a new country, experiencing different cultures, learning new skills and potentially doing a completely different job, while benefiting from a time out. </p>
