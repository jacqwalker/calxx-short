            <div class="blog-text-section">
              <p class="bold-para">It’s that time of year again. The time of Strictly Come Dancing, The Apprentice, Bonfire Night, Christmas advertising and, of course, the annual performance review. It's not only the Marks and Spencer ‘thank you bear’ advert that is currently creating controversy. Competing for that space are the annual performance reviews. To leave employees feeling good this year, we will explore how best to give feedback, and it's from Strictly Come Dancing that we find inspiration.</p>
              <p>Strictly Come Dancing is the X Factor of the dance world. It even has a Simon Cowell equivalent judge in Craig Revel-Horwood. Craig is straight talking, blunt and regularly booed by the audience. He is slow to show his approval but contestants who succeed in obtaining it, know how well they have done. As Mr Darcy said to Elizabeth Bennet in Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, "your good opinion is rarely bestowed and therefore more worth the earning".</p>
              <p>Compare this approach to the corporate world. In the modern workplace, managers worry about hurting someone’s feelings, or they think their direct reports cannot handle criticism. Feedback is sugar-coated, hiding its true meaning and intent. It becomes superficial and unspecific, more a tick-box exercise than something that is useful to the employee. Generic comments such as ‘improve your stakeholder management,’ ‘needs more experience’ or ‘should manage bigger projects’, leave employees none the wiser. This feedback may as well be no feedback at all.</p>
              <p>Others mistake feedback as an opportunity to be honest or put someone down.  Or they list some good things the employee has done followed by a but (employees see through this, they know that what comes after the ‘but’ is the real message). Feedback should never leave an employee feeling hurt or demotivated.</p>

                </div>
              </article>

              <p class="para-after-aside">Millennials, or Generation Y, want ‘in the moment’ feedback. Instead of waiting until the end of the year, when management holds most performance discussions behind closed doors, they want to hear about how they are doing right now so they can improve both their current and future performance. For this reason, Deloitte announced in 2015 that they were doing away with their annual appraisal. They calculated that two million hours were being spent on reviews each year and the amount of time spent did not match the benefit received. </p>

              <p class="para-after-aside">
                If we are to give regular feedback, we need to know how best to do it. For that, we can apply the Craig Revel-Horwood approach.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are five aspects of Craig’s feedback method:
              </p>

              <ol>
                1. He gives feedback as soon as the routine has finished. Although the show is set out in this format, it should be no different in the corporate world. Timely feedback is key.
              </ol>
              <ol>
                2.	He (and the other judges) have a time limit in which to give feedback, so he is forced to get to the point and be succinct.
              </ol>
              <ol>
                3.	He doesn't follow the popular 'how to give feedback' advice, which is to start with what went well, move onto what did not work and then finish with a positive comment. Instead, he lists the things that did not work first and then follows it with what, in his opinion, did work. It gives a more balanced view of the performance. If we start off listing all the good bits, employees don't pay attention as they are waiting for the inevitable punch. They forget what went well.
              </ol>
              <ol>
                4.	He keeps it simple. Being told your thumb is sticking up, leaves you in no doubt of what was wrong and how to fix it. Being told your outermost digit was not in the correct position is meaningless and unnecessary. Feedback should always be simple and specific.
              </ol>
              <ol>
                5.	As he focusses on the performance, his personal feelings towards the contestant are irrelevant. His feedback is objective and not an attack on someone’s personality or character.
              </ol>
              <p>
                When it comes to giving feedback, don't overlook how much employees value it. They want to know where they've done well and what they need to work on to improve their future performance. Constructive feedback won't hurt or demotivate anyone. Given for the right reasons, to improve performance or help someone reach their potential, will leave a positive mark on that employee forever.
