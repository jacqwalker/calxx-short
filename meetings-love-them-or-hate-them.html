              <p class="bold-para">Most meetings are a waste of time.</p>
              <p>A bold statement, but one that rings true. The number of meetings being held is increasing year on year and there is an insufficient return on the time invested for companies and their employees.</p>
              <p>Thomas Sewell, an American economist, turned social theorist, political philosopher, and author said, “People who enjoy meetings should not be in charge of anything … the least productive people are usually the ones who are most in favour of holding meetings.”</p>
              <p>He’s not the only one. Mark Cuban, Shark Tank investor (the US equivalent of Dragons Den) reportedly said he doesn’t attend meetings unless someone is writing cheque. Considering his net worth is about $3.4 billion, imagine the value he must place on his time.</p>
              <p>Meetings are being used as a tool to promote the appearance of busy and productive workers. It is the equivalent of running around an office with a stack of folders and papers. We rush from meeting to meeting, enjoying the status that comes from being able to brag about how busy we are, but we, and the companies we work for, are paying a heavy price for this illusion. Meetings cost time which could be better spent finding new customers, generating ideas, or improving current processes.  And if all of that isn’t enough to convince you, they also severely impact our ability to get our jobs done and leave work on time. </p>

              <article class="blog-aside">
                <div class="blog-aside-div">
                  “People who enjoy meetings should not be in charge of anything … the least productive people are usually the ones who are most in favour of holding meetings.”
                </div>
              </article>

              <p class="para-after-aside">What has brought us to this point?  The culture of meetings is changing, showing a damaging new trend that I have termed “meeting creep.”  The number of meetings that we hold in our daily work lives is increasing, but so have the number of attendees.  This has been a gradual change, and according to the <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/07/stop-the-meeting-madness" target="_blank" class="font-blue">Harvard Business Review</a>, executives now spend an average of almost 23 hours a week attending scheduled meetings.  These statistics are staggering on their own, and are likely even higher when you consider the number of gatherings that never make it onto the schedule to begin with.  The study for these numbers was released in 2007, and when you consider the rapid advancement in technology which has made meetings easier to set-up and run, (and no longer actually require attendees to be in the same room, or even the same country!), it is no stretch to assume that meeting creep will only become more of an issue.</p>

              <p>If companies took the time to calculate the cost of meetings they would be stunned. In 2014, Bain & Company conducted <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/01/estimate-the-cost-of-a-meeting-with-this-calculator" target="_blank" class="font-blue">research</a> that concluded that a single weekly meeting of midlevel managers  could cost a single organisation $15 million per year. And it’s not just traditional meetings that are the problem. The corporate world is full of jargon that masks the fact that a meeting is taking place.   ‘Lunch and learns’, ‘senior leader talks’, ‘learning circles,’ and ‘networking coffees’, all of these are accepted as valuable and must-do’s in any working environment. But are they?</p>

              <p class="para-after-aside">The constant distractions and all-encompassing routine stops us facing up to the reality of our working lives and it is impacting our well-being, which ultimately hurts the bottom line and success of our businesses. We need to change the meeting mind-set, and adapt our corporate culture to increase productivity and encourage job satisfaction in an environment that doesn’t thrive on wasting time. In future articles we will look at ways to improve the meeting culture. This change needs to be a collective, company-wide initiative, where time is treated as the scarce and valuable resource that it is.</p>
