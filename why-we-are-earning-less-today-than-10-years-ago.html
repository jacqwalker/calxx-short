              <p class="bold-para">French workers can do in four days what British workers do in five. That reflection was one of many in Deloitte chief economist Ian Stewart’s <span class="italics">The Monday Briefing</span> out last week. While many British workers are enjoying their summer holidays, the UK’s lacklustre productivity was in focus.</p>
              <p>According to Stewart, the UK has one of the most flexible labour markets in the world, meaning the UK is good at creating new jobs and reducing employment. However, we fall behind our European peers in wage growth. A startling contrast in Stewart’s report is real wage growth between Germany and the UK. Since 2010, real wages in Germany have lifted by 10% compared to a decline of 1.6% in the UK. Suppressed wage growth is caused by poor productivity. </p>
              <p>If we are regularly promoted, we don’t notice the disparity. Fresh off the boat in 2008, as a newly qualified accountant looking to contract, my day rate was £260 which is the equivalent to £329.68 in today’s terms. Currently, newly qualified CAs earn £300 per day. Factor in soaring house prices, higher entertainment costs and a weakening Pound, we are significantly worse off than someone in a similar position nearly a decade earlier. As the numbers show, we need to improve our productivity. </p>

                  In 2016, vouchercodes, UK’s favourite voucher website (their words, not mine) polled nearly 2,000 office workers on their productivity. The employees admitted to being productive for just two hours and 53 minutes of an eight-hour workday.

              <p class="para-after-aside">
              The obvious solution is to eliminate distractions in the workplace. Open plan offices, meetings, the internet and smartphones which can divert our attention for hours, changes how we work. The technological advancement has happened so quickly, we are struggling to keep up. The last time we saw such a dramatic change in our environment was the start of the industrial revolution. According to <a href="https://livinginliminality.files.wordpress.com/2008/09/gin.pdf?utm_source=Gapingvoid+Daily+Email&utm_campaign=514e24cd82-%232030+%22Trust%22+January+30%2C+2018_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_c141d052e6-514e24cd82-262699077&mc_cid=514e24cd82&mc_eid=890d8eea22" target="_blank" class="font-blue">Clay Shirky</a>, a professor at New York University, the transformation from rural to urban life was so sudden that all society could do was drink itself into a stupor. Gin was the spirit of choice. Once society woke up from their “collective bender”, they could exploit the advantages of urban life and create the city infrastructure that we know today. </p>
              <p>The boom in the craft gin market may be a sign we are repeating the past, but until we can adapt to technology and reap the benefits, our productivity will suffer. We’ve previously explored reducing the time we spend in <a href="https://www.calxx.co.uk/why-no-meeting-should-be-longer-than-15-minutes" class="font-blue" target="_blank">meetings</a> and have challenged whether the <a href="https://www.calxx.co.uk/why-the-traditional-9am-to-5pm-is-no-longer-working" target="_blank" class="font-blue">traditional 9am to 5pm</a> is still suitable but looking to eliminate distractions in the workplace is only solving part of the productivity problem. Another option is to improve employee engagement.</p>
              <p>A New Zealand based company, Perpetual Guardian which manages trusts, wills and estate planning, ran a never done before trial on productivity. Andrew Barnes, the CEO and Founder, was inspired by productivity reports and his own employee surveys to see what could be done to improve productivity. Over March and April, all employees were given one day off work but were still paid for the full week. The result? An unprecedented success that the company is looking to make it permanent. </p>

              <article class="blog-aside">
                <div class="blog-aside-div italics">
                  One of the researches tasked with monitoring employee performance before, during and after the trial said “… staff were more creative, their attendance was better, they were on time, and they didn’t leave or take long breaks. Their actual job performance didn’t change when doing it over four days instead of five.” – New York Times
                </div>
              </article>

              <p class="para-after-aside">Perhaps employee engagement improves if one has more control and flexibility over their work week. And perhaps happier employees leads to better productivity. Employers shouldn’t be scared to get creative and build on what other companies are trying to do, with unlimited leave policies or now shorter work weeks. 
              </p>
              <p>We can no longer ignore low productivity, high levels of distraction in the workplace and disengaged employees as it is hurting both our quality of life and a company’s success. We can all do more to drive wage growth to keep pace with our European counterparts because if we do achieve this feat, the next time we are enjoying a summer holiday on a European beach, with or without that gin and tonic, it will be that much cheaper.</p>
