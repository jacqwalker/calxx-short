        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Your privacy is important to us and we are committed to protecting and safeguarding your data.</p>
        <p>
          Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), effective 25 May 2018, we must comply with certain requirements which are designed to ensure that any data you provide to us is processed with due care and attention.</p> 

        <p>This privacy policy explains what personal data we collect and how we collect, use and process this data ensuring we comply with our legal obligations to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may update our privacy policy from time to time. Please just visit this page if you want to stay up to date as we will post any changes here.
        </p>

        <h3>What personal data do we collect?</h3>
        <p>We collect and process Sensitive Personal Data only so far as is necessary to aid the recruitment process and provide you with the best possible service. </p>

        <p>
        A number of elements of the personal data we collect from you are required to enable us to fulfil our contractual duties to you or to others. Depending on the type of personal data in question and the grounds on which we may be processing it, should you decline to provide us with such data, we may not be able to fulfil our contractual requirements or, in extreme cases, may not be able to continue with our relationship.
        </p>

        <p>
          For details of the legal bases that we rely on to be able to use and process your personal data, please refer to the legal basis section below.

This includes information such as how you use our website, the frequency with which you access our website, and the times that our website is most popular.

        </p>

        <h3>How do we collect your personal data?</h3>
        <h4 class="font-blue">Candidates</h4>
        <p>We only collect data that you directly submit to us either by signing up for job alerts and/or our newsletter or when you apply for a role on our website through the online application form.</p>

        <h4 class="font-blue">Hiring companies</h4>
        <p>
          We collect data directly from you, either through information you submit through our online contact forms or if you contact us directly.
        </p>

        <h4 class="font-blue">Website users</h4>
        <p>When you visit our website, there is certain information that we may automatically collect, whether or not you decide to use our services. Please refer to our <a href="#cookiepolicy" class="font-blue">cookie policy</a>y section below.</p>

        <h3>How do we use your personal data?</h3>
        <h4 class="font-blue">Candidates</h4>
        <h5>Job alerts and newsletter</h5>
        <p>
          You can elect to receive either job alerts, our newsletter or both job alerts and our newsletter. Based on what you have consented to receive, we will send you job alerts relevant to your level of experience and/or our newsletter.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you are not happy about our approach to marketing, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time and can find out more about how to do so <a href="#consent" class="font-blue">here</a>
        </p>

        <h5>Applying for roles</h5>
        <p>
          When you apply for roles, you are consenting to have the information that you submit sent directly to the hiring company. This information is only shared with the hiring company that you are applying to. The online application form is also sent to <span class="calxx-font">calxx</span> to ensure that the form has submitted correctly.
        </p>

        <h5>Marketing activities</h5>
        <p>We may periodically send you information that we think you may find interesting, or to ask for your help with connecting other Candidates with jobs. </p>
        <p>We need your consent for some aspects of these activities which are not covered by our legitimate interests (in particular, the collection of data via cookies, and the delivery of direct marketing to you through digital channels) and, depending on the situation, we'll ask for this via an opt-in or soft-opt-in. </p>
        <p>
          Soft opt-in consent is a specific type of consent which applies where you have previously engaged with us (for example by submitting a job application or CV, or registering a vacancy to be filled), and we are marketing other recruitment-related services. Under ‘soft opt-in’ consent, we will take your consent as given unless or until you opt out. For most people, this is beneficial as it allows us to suggest other jobs to you alongside the specific one you applied for, significantly increasing the likelihood of us finding you a new position. For other types of e-marketing, we are required to obtain your explicit consent.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you want to know more about how we obtain consent, please click <a href="#legalbasisconsent" class="font-blue">here</a>. If you are not happy about our approach to marketing, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time and can find out more about how to do so <a href="#consent" class="font-blue">here</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          We want to let you know that even if you have opted out from our marketing communications, it is possible that your details may be recaptured through public sources in an unconnected marketing campaign. We will try to make sure this doesn't happen, but we apologise if it does. In these circumstances, we ask that you opt out again.
        </p>

        <h5>Other</h5>
        <p>
          We may use your personal data for the above purposes if we deem it necessary to do so for our legitimate interests. If you want to know more about what this means, please click <a href="#legalbasislegitimateinterest" class="font-blue">here</a>.

        </p>

        <h5>Marketing activities</h5>
        <p>
          Subject to any applicable local laws and requirements, we will not, as a matter of course, seek your consent when sending marketing materials to a corporate postal or email address.
        </p>

        <p>

        <h3>How can you access, amend or take back the personal data that you have given to us?</h3>
        <p>
          Under GDPR, individuals have a right to be informed about the collection and use of their personal data. This means that you retain various rights in respect of your data, even once you have given it to us. These are described in more detail below. To get in touch about these rights, please contact us at <a href="mailto:hello@calxx.co.uk" class="font-blue">hello@calxx.co.uk</a>. We will seek to deal with your request without undue delay, and in any event within one month (subject to any extensions to which we are lawfully entitled).

        </p>

        <p>
          You may ask us to confirm what information we hold about you at any time, and request us to modify, update or delete such information. We may ask you to verify your identity and for more information about your request. If we provide you with access to the information we hold about you, we will not charge you for this unless your request is "manifestly unfounded or excessive". If you request further copies of this information from us, we may charge you a reasonable administrative cost where legally permissible. Where we are legally permitted to do so, we may refuse your request. If we refuse your request we will always tell you the reasons for doing so.
        </p>

        <h5 class="bold">Right to access</h5>
        <ul>
          You have the right to obtain confirmation that your data is being processed and access to the personal data that we currently have stored in our secure databases. 
        </ul>

        <h5 class="bold">Right to rectification</h5>
        <ul>
          You have the right to have inaccurate personal data rectified or completed if it is incomplete. You can make a request for rectification verbally or in writing and we will respond within one month from the date that we receive the request.
        </ul>

        <h5 class="bold">Right to erasure</h5>

        <ul class="terms-line-items">You have the right to have their personal data erased if:
          <li>
            the personal data is no longer necessary for the purpose which we originally collected or processed it for;
          </li>
          <li>
            if we are relying on legitimate interests as our basis for processing, you can object to the processing of your data if there is no overriding legitimate interest to continue this processing;
          </li>
          <li>
            if we are processing the personal data for direct marketing purposes and you object to that processing;
          </li>
          <li>
            if we have processed the personal data unlawfully;
          </li>
          <li>
            if we have to do it to comply with a legal obligation; or
          </li>
          <li>
            if we have processed the personal data to offer information society services to a child.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <ul class="terms-line-items">The right to erasure does not apply if processing is necessary for one of the following reasons:
          <li>
            to exercise the right of freedom of expression and information;
          </li>
          <li>
            to comply with a legal obligation;
          </li>
          <li>
            for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority;
          </li>
          <li>
            for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific research historical research or statistical purposes where erasure is likely to render impossible or seriously impair the achievement of that processing; or
          </li>
          <li>
            for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>You can make a request for erasure verbally or in writing and we will respond within one month from the date that we receive the request.</p>

        <h5 class="bold">Right to restrict processing</h5>
        <ul class="terms-line-items">You have the right to restrict the processing of your personal data in certain circumstances:
          <li>
            if you contest the accuracy of your personal data and we are verifying the accuracy of the data;
          </li>
          <li>
            if the data has been unlawfully processed (ie in breach of the lawfulness requirement of the first principle of the GDPR) and you oppose erasure and requests restriction instead; or
          </li>
          <li>
            if we no longer need the personal data but you need us to keep it in order to establish, exercise or defend a legal claim
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h5 class="bold">Right to data portability</h5>

        <ul>If you wish, you have the right to transfer your personal data between data controllers. In effect, this means that you are able to transfer your <span class="calxx-font">calxx</span> account details to another online platform. To allow you to do so, we will provide you with your data in a commonly used machine-readable format that is password-protected so that you can transfer the data to another online platform. Alternatively, we may directly transfer the data for you. This right of data portability applies to: (i) personal data that we process automatically (i.e. without any human intervention); (ii) personal data provided by you; and (iii) personal data that we process based on your consent or in order to fulfil a contract.</ul>

        <h5 class="bold" id="righttoobject">Right to object</h5>
        <ul class="terms-line-items">
          You have the right to object the processing of data in the following situations:
          <li>
            processing based on legitimate interests or the performance of a task in the public interest/exercise of official authority (including profiling);
          </li>
          <li>
            direct marketing (including profiling); and
          </li>
          <li>
            processing for purposes of scientific/historical research and statistics.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          The "legitimate interests" and "direct marketing" categories above are the ones most likely to apply to our Website Users, Candidates and Hiring Managers. If your objection relates to us processing your personal data because we deem it necessary for your legitimate interests, we must act on your objection by ceasing the activity in question unless:
          <li>
            - we can show that we have compelling legitimate grounds for processing which overrides your interests; or
          </li>
          <li>
            - we are processing your data for the establishment, exercise or defence of a legal claim.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          If your objection relates to direct marketing, we must act on your objection by ceasing this activity.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you would like to exercise any of these rights, please contact us at <a href="mailto:hello@calxx.co.uk" class="font-blue">hello@calxx.co.uk</a>. Please note that we may keep a record of your communications to help us resolve any issues which you raise.
        </p>

        <h5 class="bold" id="consent">Right to withdraw consent</h5>
        <p>
          Where we have obtained your consent to process your personal data for certain activities (for example, where you have consented to receive job alerts and/or our newsletter), you may withdraw this consent at any time and we will cease to carry out the particular activity that you previously consented to unless we consider that there is an alternative reason to justify our continued processing of your data for this purpose in which case we will inform you of this condition.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you would like to exercise your right to withdraw your consent to the processing of your personal data, there are two ways to do this. Either contact us at <a href="mailto:hello@calxx.co.uk" class="font-blue">hello@calxx.co.uk</a> and let us know you want to unsubscribe your details or you can select the ‘manage preferences link’ or ‘unsubscribe link’ in the job alerts or newsletter email that you receive from us and update your details accordingly.
        </p>

        <h3>Our legal bases for processing your data</h3>
        <p>
          We use consent and legitimate interest as the legal bases for processing your data.
        </p>

        <h5 id="legalbasisconsent" class="font-blue">Consent</h5>
        <p>
          In certain circumstances, we are required to obtain your consent to the processing of your personal data in relation to certain activities. Depending on exactly what we are doing with your information, this consent will be opt-in consent or soft opt-in consent.
        </p>

        <p>
          When you sign up for job alerts, our newsletter or both job alerts and our newsletter, apply for roles through our platform, use our platform to enquire about our services or use our platform to advertise vacancies, you have provided opt-in consent for us to process your data.
        </p>

        <ul>
          Article 4(11) of the GDPR states that (opt-in) consent is "any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her." In plain language, this means that:
          <li>
            - you have to give us your consent freely, without us putting you under any type of pressure;
          </li>
          <li>
            - you have to know what you are consenting to – so we'll make sure we give you enough information;
          </li>
          <li>
            - you should have control over which processing activities you consent to and which you don’t. We provide these finer controls within our privacy preference centre; and
          </li>
          <li>
            - you need to take positive and affirmative action in giving us your consent – we're likely to provide a tick box for you to check so that this requirement is met in a clear and unambiguous fashion.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We will keep records of the consents that you have given in this way.
        </p>

        <p>
          We have already mentioned that, in some cases, we will be able to rely on soft opt-in consent. We are allowed to market products or services to you which are related to the recruitment services we provide as long as you do not actively opt-out from these communications. You have the right to withdraw your consent to these activities. You can do so at any time, and details of how to do so can be found <a class="font-blue" href="#consent">here</a>.
        </p>

        <h5 id="legalbasislegitimateinterest" class="font-blue">Legitimate interest</h5>
        <p>
          Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR says that we can process your data where it "is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by [us] or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights or freedoms of [you] which require protection of personal data."
        </p>

        <p>
          Our services are to help candidates find roles and hiring companies find candidates so we don't think that any of the following activities prejudice individuals in any way. However, you do have the right to object to us processing your personal data on this basis. If you would like to know more about how to do so, please click <a class="font-blue" href="#righttoobject">here</a>.
        </p>

        <h5>Candidate data</h5>
        <p>We think it's reasonable to expect that if you have applied for a role on our website, we can process your data to send you relevant jobs alerts to aid with your job search. </p>

        <h5>Hiring company data</h5>

        <p>To ensure that we provide you with the best service possible, we store your personal data and/or the personal data of individual contacts at your organisation as well as keeping records of our conversations, meetings, registered jobs and placements. From time to time, we may also ask you to undertake a customer satisfaction survey. We think this is reasonable – we deem these uses of your data to be necessary for our legitimate interests as an organisation providing various recruitment services to you.</p>
