              <p class="bold-para">"Why did the auditor cross the road? Because last years’ audit file told him to."</p>
              <p>There is no denying that auditors have a sense of humour. We need one, given our line of work, but within the joke lies a valuable lesson. We sometimes forget to stop and question the status quo. We copy what others have done, assuming there is a valid reason behind it, even if we don’t know what that reason is. Society’s rules and cultural norms influence us, but these rules aren't necessarily relevant for how we operate in today's world. One such example is asking potential employees their current (or past) salary information. </p>
              <p>Earlier this year, Amazon announced a company-wide policy that bans all hiring managers from asking job applicants interviewing for positions in the United States their salary history. Amazon is not the first to do it, having followed the likes of Facebook and Google. These companies are making it easier for US states to introduce legislation in support of it. New York City and California are two states to have already done so. </p>
              <p>Policies like these are an attempt to address the gender pay gap. Women don’t necessarily negotiate as well as men, but regardless of gender, a worker who accepts a low salary at some point in their career could still feel the impact of that poor or possibly naive decision years later. </p>
              <p>The most common explanation for needing salary information is that it helps place candidates in the right position. This approach is a dangerous one to take as it overlooks the human element. Rather than assessing each candidate for their unique skill set, potential and value they bring, we blanket people together and use money as an equaliser. If we adopted this approach in the sporting world, no athlete would ever get a break. They’d always be defined by what they had previously earned, capping their potential. We'd overlook the possibility that hard work, practice and determination has changed them into a player with immense talent; a player unrecognisable from the one who embarked on their career.</p>

                <div class="blog-aside-div italics">
                  56% of the ACA community think we should stop asking for current or past salary informtion
                </div>
              </article>

              <p class="para-after-aside">Also, consider this contradiction. It's frowned upon to ask family or friends how much they earn, even though we all secretly want to know, yet it is normal for recruitment agents to ask for salary information. If you google "why do recruiters need to know my salary", there is no legal requirement to provide the data. So when did it become socially acceptable for recruiters to know? 
              </p>
              <p>If there is no good reason to ask potential hires their salary information, then we need to consider whether the UK should follow the example set in the US. I sent a poll to the ACA community, wanting their views on whether to outlaw the salary question. Of the 79 respondents, 56% were in favour of the ban. I'm sure a YouGov or similar survey would produce the same result.</p>
              <p>So, in conclusion, let us be the auditor that stops crossing the road when we can't explain why we need to; the one who challenges the status quo and puts in motion new practices that are relevant to how we operate today. By stopping the awkward salary conversations, we can instead focus the discussion on skills, value and potential.</p>
