              <p class="bold-para">Office workers will have something other than the Facebook Cambridge Analytica scandal to talk about at the water cooler this week. Companies have one week to go to report on their gender pay gap, and early findings show that over two-thirds of companies pay men more. </p>

              <p>For the first time, UK companies with at least 250 employees are required to report on their gender pay gap. The gender pay gap is the difference between what firms pay their male and female staff. The pay gap is different to equal pay which requires companies to pay men and women equally for the same role. Equal pay has been a legal requirement since 1970.</p>

              <p>Banking, aviation, mining and oil and gas companies show a significant pay gap. The pay gap reports indicate not only an underrepresentation of women in senior and technical roles but also in the workforce. In the oil and gas sector, for example, 20% of the workforce is female. </p>

              <p>Companies admit more can be done to improve the imbalance. Common themes to address this include flexible working options, mentoring, new career opportunities and forming diversity and inclusion committees. Some reports say that young girls need to be encouraged into the STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths) field. These subjects are the lead into the banking, aviation, mining and oil and gas sectors, but a lower proportion of women study STEM subjects at school and university. </p>

              <p>But should it only be the companies’ responsibility to encourage girls in these areas? We know bias exists in the workplace, but there is also bias in the home and at school as to which careers are suitable for young boys and girls. Are girls actively encouraged to enter the oil and gas sector or become pilots? And who is leading those discussions?
              </p>

              <article class="blog-aside">
                <div class="blog-aside-div">
                  In the aviation sector, 95% of pilots are male compared to a 70% to 80% female cabin crew. Pilots earn £111,000 per year on average, and the cabin crew earn approximately £27,000.
                </div>
              </article>

              <p class="para-after-aside">It does, however, work both ways. Phase Eight, a women’s fashion retailer, has a 97% female workforce but men get paid 54% more (on average). The majority of women work on the shop floor, while men sit in head office. Either this is the traditional role women have assumed or customers prefer female shop assistants. But if we want diversity in the workplace, we need it in all areas of our life, starting on the shop floor. And maybe a man’s opinion on what to wear will prove invaluable.</p>

              <p>
                Overcoming the inherent bias of what is considered a suitable career based on gender will be challenging. But until we do, we will continue to see similar comments in the gender pay gap reports as submitted by Yellow Dot Nursery, a nursery school specialising in children aged between four months and five years. “We are working hard to encourage men to join our team and be promoted upwards through our organisation.”
