              <p class="bold-para">In a BBC CEO secrets <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/business-35549386/ceo-secrets-easyjet-boss-shares-three-tips-for-success" target="_blank"> video</a>, the current CEO of EasyJet Dame Carolyn McCall, shared business advice she wished she’d got when starting out. She gives a lot of great advice, but the main point I took from it was ‘love what you do.’</p>
              <p>McCall announced this week that she will be taking the helm of ITV in January 2018. Simon Jack, business editor for the BBC, heard her described as “straight talking, no-nonsense, charming, and effective.” Since she joined EasyJet in 2010, the company’s share price has increased over 300% and passenger numbers by 56%.  In short, she’s a great role model to show how loving what you do leads to success.</p>
              <p>Too often, in the quest to climb the Corporate ladder, we overlook the fact that we need to enjoy our jobs. We chase promotions, status and additional salary, but before too long we become so used to the extras that we don’t get the same boost as when we first started out. For so many people, all we have left is the job and if it’s not one that interests us, it will be that much harder to succeed. There is always something to find interesting about any career, but it’s easier to like what you do, rather than dig deeper to find the parts you truly enjoy.</p>
              <p>Finding the job that will give you the most enjoyment and satisfaction isn’t easy. It might not be available when you want it, and well-meaning but unhelpful advisors (including mentors and senior management) may suggest taking a certain job today which could open doors down the road rather than holding out for something you’ll really enjoy in the here and now. You may even be told you don’t have the skill set for the job you dream of. But don’t let that stop you.</p>

              <p class="para-after-aside">The further I get into my career the more it becomes apparent that you can’t predict what will happen. The hiring manager who said you didn’t have the required skill set often moves on and is replaced by someone with differing views. The job you wanted, the reason you settled for your current one, is made redundant. Jobs come and go, as do people.</p>

              <p>It’s not just in your interest to find the occupation you’ll love, it’s also for the benefit of the company you work for. Psychologist Angela Duckworth in her book  <span class="italics">Grit:The Power of Passion and Perseverance</span> says that when you do what interests you, you’ll do your job better, will be more helpful to colleagues, and you’ll stay in the same career longer.</p>

              <p class="para-after-aside">If you don’t know what job interests you, (and don’t worry, many people don’t), the best thing to do is try different things and see what sticks. Volunteer for projects, ask for a secondment and don’t be afraid to do a bit of job hopping. I recently asked for a new project myself. I’ve expanded my network, learnt about other businesses and been part of a startup venture. Best of all, it has steered me in the right direction to what I want to do next. Don’t be afraid to look for the next opportunity and put yourself forward to find what you really love doing.</p>
