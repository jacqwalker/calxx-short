              <p class="bold-para">They say sitting is the new smoking but I would argue that workplace loneliness is. Loneliness is shown to have a significantly negative impact on our health and is a growing epidemic which needs to be addressed.</p>
              <p>Last week I overheard a colleague ask, ‘who would want to go away with their work colleagues?’ The group laughed and were in agreement. The idea of being friends with colleagues was simply ridiculous. Yet, when we were at school or university, the opposite was true. We were actively encouraged to make friends. You didn’t want to be labelled as anti-social or the weird kid with no mates. </p>
              <p>We typically spend at least 40 hours a week at work. This is more time with our colleagues than family or close friends. If we are not spending time with people that we really value and care about, people that we would like to see outside office hours, then something is wrong. Forty hours is too much time to be with people we wouldn’t ordinarily choose to socialise with. </p>
              <p>Maybe close interactions are frowned upon if they are perceived as not being productive. Or maybe we are so busy trying to look good or climb the career ladder that it impacts our ability to form relationships. There could be any number of reasons for why we choose to isolate ourselves, but regardless, there is a cost to the bottom line. A Harvard Business Review <a href="https://hbr.org/cover-story/2017/09/work-and-the-loneliness-epidemic" target="_blank" class="font-blue">article</a> out last month said that “having strong social connections at work makes employees more likely to be engaged with their jobs and produce higher-quality work, and less likely to fall sick or be injured”. It adds that loneliness has the same impact on lifespan as smoking 15 cigarettes a day. Loneliness, like mental health, might be an uncomfortable conversation to have, but we cannot ignore it.</p>
              <p>Last week, on Tuesday October 10th, was World Mental Health Day. The hashtag trending on the day (#WorldMentalhealthDay) had a clear message. More needs to be done to address mental health and we must encourage open discussion about it, especially in the workplace; discussion without any consequences to employees such as disciplinary action, demotion or even dismissal.</p>

              <article class="blog-aside">
                <div class="blog-aside-div">
                  “having strong social connections at work makes employees more likely to be engaged with their jobs and produce higher-quality work, and less likely to fall sick or be injured”
                </div>
              </article>

              <p class="para-after-aside">Soma Analytics, a digital wellbeing platform that helps employers reduce costs of employee absenteeism, presenteeism, and turnover, has published a report on mental health and wellbeing. Their aim was to test the hypothesis that a healthier workplace is a more productive one. Having analysed over 20,000 pages from FTSE 100 2016 Annual Reports, they found that companies who care about mental health and wellbeing fared better financially, being almost three times more profitable on average.</p>

              <p>All of this is moving in the right direction but I do wonder whether workplace loneliness is being overlooked. Companies not only need to focus on mental health and wellbeing, they need to foster more collaborative and caring work environments. It comes down to bonding with your colleagues and superficial talk at the watercooler doesn’t cut it. Real connection is formed by spending quality time with colleagues, not sharing a joke while sitting behind a laptop, enquiring after someone’s weekend or bragging about an upcoming holiday.</p>

    
              <p class="para-after-aside">The HBR article referenced above says that real connection requires an environment that embraces the unique identities and experiences of employees inside and outside the workplace. They list five steps to help build healthy and productive relationships, one of which is to make social connections a strategic priority in one’s organisation. Strategy has typically been synonymous with deciding in which direction to head, what capital projects to invest in, or which new market to enter. Now, companies need to consider relationship building as part of their strategy. This requires cooperation at all levels, and a bit of creativity.</p>
              <p><a href="https://www.inc.com/chad-perry/walmart-just-created-a-side-hustle-for-its-1-million-employees-should-you-do-the.html?cid=sf01001&sr_share=twitter" target="_blank" class="font-blue">Walmart</a> recently ran a trial, giving their employees the option to make deliveries on their way home to earn some extra money . This was a clever way to use the workforce, keep them engaged and provide opportunities for their employees to form connections.
              </p>
              <p>Think back to audit days.  Working under pressure and late into the night often created camaraderie and a sense of kinship for those involved. Late night hilarity, a common goal or deadline, and people at their most authentic when tired allowed friendships to be formed. Companies could look to recreate this.</p>
              <p>Atlassian (a software company) do something similar with their <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/company/shipit" target="_blank" class="font-blue">Shipit</a> days. They give teams 24 hours to work on finding a solution for something that needs fixing in the organisation (whether a company has been established for 100 years or just one, there is always something that can be done better). They create a pressure environment, get them to work through the night and finally, let them have one hell of a party 24 hours later (after they have reported out their ideas, of course). Not only will you be surprised by what the teams come up with, but I guarantee that the foundation for building solid relationships between colleagues will have been set.</p>
              <p>
                Loneliness is bad for our health and it is bad for business so now is the time to start thinking of ideas to create more collaborative and caring work environments and cure the workplace loneliness epidemic.
