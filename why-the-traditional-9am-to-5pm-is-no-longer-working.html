            <div class="blog-text-section">
              <p class="bold-para">Last month, BBC news reported that nearly two thirds of British workers would prefer to start their workday earlier than the traditional 9am to 5pm.</p>
              <p>Interested to know what the chartered accountant community thought, I created a similar anonymous poll. The response was fantastic. What started as mere curiosity to find the preferred start time for ACAs, developed into whether the eight-hour workday is still relevant. This article will share the outcome of the poll and assess whether the traditional working day needs to be reviewed.</p>
              <p>The eight-hour workday was introduced in the 19th Century, with many countries only adopting it in the early 1900s, to protect workers from abuse and excesses. Until this point, workers could work between 10 and 16 hours per day, six days a week. When Henry Ford began closing his automobile factory on Saturdays and Sundays in 1926 to offer better working conditions and attract workers from his competitors, it cemented the idea of the weekend. Yet nearly a hundred years later, the length of the workday or work week remains the same. In Britain, this workday has traditionally started at 9am. </p>
              <p>In a poll conducted by YouGov, nearly two thirds of the 1,965 British workers surveyed would prefer to start and end their workday before the traditional 9am to 5pm. The most popular option, 8am to 4:30pm was chosen by 25% of the respondents, 13% favoured 8:30am to 4pm and 10% preferred 7am to 3pm. Adjusting for location and age, a quarter of London workers and nearly one in five respondents aged 18 to 24 said they wanted to start work after 9am.</p>
              <p>My poll was less sophisticated. I did not ask for age or location, and I cannot hand on heart say that 100% of respondents were ACAs (the poll was shared with the ICAEW group on Linked in) but of the 125 submissions, 47% were in favour of an 8am to 4:30pm workday. </p>

                <div class="blog-aside-div">
                    The question posed to the ACA community was: 'What would be your preferred working hours?'
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      - 7am to 3:30pm: 22% selected
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      - 8am to 4:30pm: 47% selected
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      - 8:30am to 5pm: 16% selected
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      - 9am to 5:30pm: 6% selected
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      - 9:30am to 6pm: 9% selected
                    </li>

              <p class="para-after-aside">Neither poll addressed the length of the workday. An off the cuff response to my poll had one person suggest a workday of 10am to 4pm. This may seem laughable but we shouldn’t be too quick to dismiss the idea. We are entering the 4th Industrial Revolution – the technology age. While an eight-hour workday might have been suitable for those on an assembly line where a set number of units could be produced per hour, in the information age, eight hours is an arbitrary yardstick to measure output or productivity. What takes one person a few hours to achieve could be done by another in two. Yet we are still forced to be seen in an office for at least eight hours a day. </p>
              <p>
                We could achieve more in less time if we were forced to ruthlessly prioritise and avoided the distractions of <a href="https://www.calxx.co.uk/meetings-love-them-or-hate-them" target="_blank">meetings</a>, emails and even open planned offices which are not necessarily conducive to focussed work. Cal Newport in his book <span class="italics">Deep Work: Rules for Focussed Success in a Distracted World</span> says, “busyness and exhaustion should be your enemy. If you’re chronically stressed and up late working, you’re doing something wrong. Do less. But do what you do with complete, hard focus. Then when you’re done, be done, and go enjoy the rest of your day”.
              </p>

              <p class="para-after-aside">
                To help employees maximise their effectiveness, why not give them the choice of when to start their day? Or take it a step further and let them decide how many hours they need to work to get the job done. Having a flexible workday allows employees to feel in control of their time, the burden on public transport could be alleviated if the workdays are staggered, and those with children can adjust their work schedule around them. Those without kids won’t feel hard done by if they too can determine their hours, rather than feeling the only way to head out the door outside the working day norm is to have a child related reason.
              </p>
              <p>
                As the polls suggest, at a minimum, the start and end times of workdays needs to be rethought as the traditional 9am to 5pm is no longer the preference for the majority of British workers. Moving the start time to the most popular option is not the answer as employees should have the freedom to choose their workday. Going one step further, the length of the workday should also be reviewed. Companies already need to offer a more flexible working environment due to the rise of the <a href="https://www.calxx.co.uk/sabbatical-or-jobbatical" target="_blank">Millennials</a> and Generation Z in the workplace, and the workday is a good foundation to achieve this flexibility.
